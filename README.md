## 🧩 About Me

I'm a self-taught game developer from Pakistan with 6 months of hands-on experience building games in Unity (2D & 3D). I love programming AI, crafting gameplay mechanics, and adding that extra “juice” to make games feel alive.  

Currently looking for an internship to sharpen my skills and work on real-world game projects.

> I don’t just watch tutorials. I *build* things. Break them. Fix them. Repeat.
